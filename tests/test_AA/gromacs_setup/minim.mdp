; minim.mdp - used as input into grompp to generate em.tpr
; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
integrator	= steep		; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol		= 500.0  	; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 1000.0 kJ/mol/nm
emstep          = 0.001          ; Energy step size
nsteps		= 500000	; Maximum number of (minimization) steps to perform

; Parameters describing how to find the neighbors of each atom and how to calculate the interactions
nstlist		= 20		; Frequency to update the neighbor list and long range forces
ns_type		= grid		; Method to determine neighbor list (simple, grid)
rlist		= 1.0		; Cut-off for making neighbor list (short range forces)
coulombtype	= PME		; Treatment of long range electrostatic interactions
rcoulomb	= 1.0		; Short-range electrostatic cut-off
rvdw		= 1.0		; Short-range Van der Waals cut-off
pbc		= xyz 		; Periodic Boundary Conditions (yes/no)
